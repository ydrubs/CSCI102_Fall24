Exercise 5.4 - Palindromes

Palindromes â€“ A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward and backward. Some examples are:
        - civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak, madam, and refer.

Write a function called palindrome_checker that accepts a one word string and returns whether the word is a palindrome.

The checker should NOT be case-sensitive so civic == Civic == CIVIC

Demonstrate the functionality of the Palindrome checker by calling the function with the argument 'Bob'.
