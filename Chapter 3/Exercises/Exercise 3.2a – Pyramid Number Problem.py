Exercise 3.2a â€“ Pyramid Number Problem

A pyramidal number has the form 1^2+2^2+3^2+.......

for example the forth pyramidal number is 30 because:
    1^2+2^2+3^2^4^2 = 1+4+9+16=30

It is also known as the cannonball stacking number becasue it represents how much spherical cannonballs
can be stacked in a pyramid shape with a given number of rows.

Your program should:

1) Ask the user how many rows of cannonballs they want to stack

2) Calculate the total number of cannonballs that will create the pyramid with the specified rows
