Exercise 2.1 - Video Rentals

Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who like to buy LP record albums.

The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and oldies for $2.00 a night.

Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video can use to calculate the total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals.

The program should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total cost.
